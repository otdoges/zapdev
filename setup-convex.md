# Convex Setup Instructions

## ✅ DEPLOYMENT FIX APPLIED

**Issue Resolved:** Fixed syntax error in ConvexChat.tsx that was preventing deployment.
- **Problem:** Extra closing parenthesis and missing closing braces in JSX structure
- **Solution:** Corrected JSX structure in the ternary operator for AnimatePresence
- **Status:** ✅ Build should now pass

Your chat creation is failing because Convex is not properly configured. Here's how to fix it:

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Create a Convex Account
1. Go to https://dashboard.convex.dev
2. Sign up or sign in
3. Click "Create Project"
4. Name your project (e.g., "zapdev")

### 2. Get Your Convex URL
After creating the project:
1. Copy the URL that looks like: `https://pleasant-walrus-123.convex.cloud`
2. Update your `.env.local` file:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-actual-convex-url.convex.cloud
   ```

### 3. Initialize Convex (Run this in PowerShell)
```powershell
# Allow script execution temporarily
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# Initialize Convex
npx convex dev

# When prompted:
# - Select your existing project OR create a new one
# - Choose TypeScript
# - This will generate a .env.local file with CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY
```

### 4. Verify Setup
After running `npx convex dev`, check that:
1. Your `.env.local` has `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` with real URL
2. Your `.env.local` has `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` (auto-generated)
3. No console warnings about "Convex not configured"

## Alternative: Manual Setup

If the above doesn't work, manually add these to your `.env.local`:

```bash
# Replace with your actual values from dashboard.convex.dev
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-actual-convex-url.convex.cloud
CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY=your_deploy_key_from_dashboard

# Your Clerk domain (already correct)
CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN=https://ideal-gopher-41.clerk.accounts.dev
```

## Testing

After setup, restart your dev server and try creating a chat. You should see:
- No "Convex not configured" warnings in console
- Chat creation works
- Messages persist across page refreshes

## Need Help?

If you still see issues, share the output of:
1. `npx convex dev --once`
2. Browser console when trying to create a chat
3. Your current `.env.local` (without secrets)
