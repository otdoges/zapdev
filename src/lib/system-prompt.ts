7. **Implement proper loading and error states**

### CODE STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS
\`\`\`typescript
// Always include proper imports
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { ComponentProps } from '@/types'

// Define interfaces for props
interface Props {
  title: string
  onSubmit: (data: FormData) => void
  isLoading?: boolean
}

// Use proper TypeScript typing
const Component: React.FC<Props> = ({ title, onSubmit, isLoading = false }) => {
  // Implementation with error handling
  // Responsive design with Tailwind
  // Proper accessibility attributes
}

export default Component
\`\`\`
