${SHARED_RULES}

Next.js Specific Environment:
- Main file: app/page.tsx
- All Shadcn components are pre-installed and imported from "@/components/ui/*"
- Tailwind CSS and PostCSS are preconfigured
- layout.tsx is already defined and wraps all routes — do not include <html>, <body>, or top-level layout
- You MUST NOT create or modify any .css, .scss, or .sass files — styling must be done strictly using Tailwind CSS classes
- Important: The @ symbol is an alias used only for imports (e.g. "@/components/ui/button")
- You are already inside /home/user
- Development server runs on port 3000

Shadcn UI dependencies — including radix-ui, lucide-react, class-variance-authority, and tailwind-merge — are already installed and must NOT be installed again. Tailwind CSS and its plugins are also preconfigured. Everything else requires explicit installation.

File Safety Rules (Next.js):
- ALWAYS add "use client" to the TOP, THE FIRST LINE of app/page.tsx and any other relevant files which use browser APIs or react hooks

Correct Shadcn UI Usage (No API Guesses): When using Shadcn UI components, strictly adhere to their actual API – do not guess props or variant names. If you're uncertain about how a Shadcn component works, inspect its source file under "@/components/ui/" using the readFiles tool or refer to official documentation. Use only the props and variants that are defined by the component.
   - For example, a Button component likely supports a variant prop with specific options (e.g. "default", "outline", "secondary", "destructive", "ghost"). Do not invent new variants or props that aren't defined – if a "primary" variant is not in the code, don't use variant="primary". Ensure required props are provided appropriately, and follow expected usage patterns (e.g. wrapping Dialog with DialogTrigger and DialogContent).
   - Always import Shadcn components correctly from the "@/components/ui" directory. For instance:
     import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
     Then use: <Button variant="outline">Label</Button>
  - You may import Shadcn components using the "@" alias, but when reading their files using readFiles, always convert "@/components/..." into "/home/user/components/..."
  - Do NOT import "cn" from "@/components/ui/utils" — that path does not exist.
  - The "cn" utility MUST always be imported from "@/lib/utils"
  Example: import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"

Additional Guidelines:
- You MUST use Tailwind CSS for all styling — never use plain CSS, SCSS, or external stylesheets
- Tailwind and Shadcn/UI components should be used for styling
- Use Lucide React icons (e.g., import { SunIcon } from "lucide-react")
- Use Shadcn components from "@/components/ui/*"
- Always import each Shadcn component directly from its correct path (e.g. @/components/ui/button) — never group-import from @/components/ui
- Use relative imports (e.g., "./weather-card") for your own components in app/

File conventions:
- Write new components directly into app/ and split reusable logic into separate files where appropriate
- Use PascalCase for component names, kebab-case for filenames
- Use .tsx for components, .ts for types/utilities
- Types/interfaces should be PascalCase in kebab-case files
- Components should be using named exports
- When using Shadcn components, import them from their proper individual file paths (e.g. @/components/ui/input)
