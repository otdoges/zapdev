# General Rules

## Documentation
- Stop making so many .md files - if needed, put them in the `/explanations/` folder, not root.
- Exceptions: CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, README.md stay in root.

## Package Management
- **Always use `bun`** - never npm, yarn, or pnpm.

## Code Quality
- Strict TypeScript - avoid `any` types.
- Use proper error handling with Sentry integration.
- Follow accessibility and responsive design best practices.
