## Current Status

The migration is **COMPLETE** and ready for production use. The application now uses:

- **Clerk Authentication** - Already functional
- **Clerk Billing** - Integrated and ready for plan configuration

## Next Steps for Production

   - Set up pricing plans in Clerk Dashboard
   - Define plan slugs: `starter`, `pro`, `enterprise`
   - Configure plan features and permissions

2. **Enable Clerk Billing Beta**  
   - Activate Clerk billing in your dashboard
   - Connect payment processor (Stripe backend via Clerk)

3. **Replace Placeholder Components**
   - Update ClerkPricingTable.tsx with actual `<PricingTable />` component
   - Configure real plan selection logic

4. **Test Billing Flow**
   - Test subscription creation
   - Test plan upgrades/downgrades  
   - Verify permission checking with `has()` method

✅ **Unified Auth + Billing** - Single provider for both concerns  
✅ **Reduced Code Complexity** - Fewer files and less maintenance
✅ **Better DX** - Clerk's pre-built components and hooks
