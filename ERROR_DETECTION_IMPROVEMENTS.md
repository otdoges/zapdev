# Error Detection & Fixing Improvements

## Summary
Enhanced error detection system to catch ECMAScript parsing errors and added a manual "Fix Errors" button that doesn't consume credits.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Error Detection Patterns (`src/inngest/functions.ts`)

**Added/Enhanced Patterns:**
- `Parsing encountered` - Catches the specific error from your screenshot
- `Parse failed`
- `sources with failed`
- `Unterminated` - For unterminated strings/expressions
- `Build State` - For build state errors
- `Transform failed` - For transformation errors
- `Transpile.*error` - For transpilation errors
- `❌` - Error emoji indicator

### 2. Build Verification System

**New Function: `runBuildCheck()`**
- Runs `bun run build` to verify the app actually builds
- Captures both stdout and stderr
- Returns detailed error output if build fails
- Integrated into post-completion validation alongside lint checks

**Integration:**
- Both lint and build checks now run in parallel after agent completion
- Errors from either check trigger the auto-fix loop
- Maximum 2 auto-fix attempts to resolve issues

### 3. Manual Error Fixing (No Credit Charge)

**New API Endpoint:** `/api/fix-errors/route.ts`
- Accepts `fragmentId` in POST request
- Triggers Inngest error-fix function
- No credit deduction for manual fixes

**New Inngest Function:** `errorFixFunction`
- Detects errors via lint and build checks
- Only runs if errors are found
- Uses AI agent to fix detected errors
- Updates fragment files with fixes
- Clearly marked as "no credit charge" in logs

**UI Button:** Added to `FragmentWeb` component
- Wrench icon button in toolbar
- Tooltip: "Fix Errors (Free)"
- Shows loading state with message: "✨ No credits will be charged for error fixes"
- Auto-refreshes iframe to show fixed code
- Polls for 2 minutes to allow fix to complete

## How It Works

### Automatic Error Detection
1. After agent completes task, system runs:
   - Lint check (`bun run lint`)
   - Build check (`bun run build`)
2. If errors detected, auto-fix triggers (max 2 attempts)
3. Agent receives detailed error output and fixes issues

### Manual Error Fixing
1. User clicks "Fix Errors" button (wrench icon)
2. API triggers `error-fix/run` event
3. System detects errors in sandbox
4. AI agent analyzes and fixes errors
5. Fragment files updated with fixes
6. UI refreshes to show fixed code
7. **No credits charged** for this operation

## Error Patterns Now Detected

The system now catches:
- ✅ ECMAScript parsing errors
- ✅ Build failures
- ✅ Syntax errors
- ✅ Type errors
- ✅ Import/module errors
- ✅ Runtime errors
- ✅ Transpilation errors
- ✅ Bundler errors (Vite, Webpack, etc.)
- ✅ Framework-specific errors
- ✅ Linting errors

## Testing

To test the improvements:
1. Create a project with intentional syntax errors
2. Verify auto-fix catches and resolves them
3. Click the "Fix Errors" button on any fragment with errors
4. Confirm no credits are deducted for manual fixes

## Files Modified

- `src/inngest/functions.ts` - Enhanced patterns, added build check, added errorFixFunction
- `src/app/api/fix-errors/route.ts` - New API endpoint
- `src/app/api/inngest/route.ts` - Registered errorFixFunction
- `src/modules/projects/ui/components/fragment-web.tsx` - Added Fix Errors button

## Notes

- Build check has 60-second timeout
- Manual fix polls for 2 minutes
- Error fixes are logged with "[DEBUG] Starting error-fix function (no credit charge)"
- System prioritizes root cause fixes over symptom masking
