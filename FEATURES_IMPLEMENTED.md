# ZapDev Advanced Features Implementation

This document outlines the Scout.new-inspired features that have been implemented in ZapDev.

## ðŸŽ¯ Newly Implemented Components

### 1. AgentModeSwitch Component

**Location:** `components/AgentModeSwitch.tsx`

Modern switch component for agent mode selection with real-time background agent status.

**Features:**
- **Three Agent Modes:**
  - `fast`: Single AI agent optimized for speed
  - `deep`: Advanced reasoning with higher quality responses
  - `background`: Multi-agent parallel execution (Pro+ only)

- **Background Agent Monitoring:**
  - Real-time agent status display
  - Progress tracking with visual progress bars
  - Estimated completion times
  - Agent type indicators (architect, developer, reviewer, deployer, researcher, optimizer)

- **Subscription-Aware:**
  - Background mode restricted to Pro+ users
  - Visual indicators for subscription requirements

**Usage:**
```tsx
import AgentModeSwitch, { type AgentMode } from '@/components/AgentModeSwitch';

<AgentModeSwitch
  currentMode={agentMode}
  onModeChange={setAgentMode}
  backgroundAgents={agents}
  showBackgroundStatus={true}
/>
```

### 2. MasterDashboard Component

**Location:** `components/MasterDashboard.tsx`

Comprehensive dashboard integrating all advanced features with Scout.new-inspired functionality.

**Features:**
- **Multi-View Navigation:**
  - Overview: System stats and quick actions
  - Autonomous: Multi-agent coordination dashboard
  - Analytics: Performance insights and metrics
  - Agents: AI agent management and configuration
  - Monitoring: Real-time system monitoring (Enterprise)

- **System Health Monitoring:**
  - Real-time health indicators
  - Component status (pipeline, orchestrator, GitHub, agents)
  - Key metrics (uptime, response time, success rate, agent utilization)

- **Subscription Management:**
  - Feature access control based on subscription tier
  - Visual upgrade prompts for restricted features
  - Pro/Enterprise feature indicators

- **Agent Mode Integration:**
  - Seamless integration with AgentModeSwitch
  - Automatic view switching based on agent mode
  - Background agent management

**Subscription Tiers:**
- **Free:** Basic agent management, overview dashboard
- **Pro:** Autonomous development, analytics, background agents
- **Enterprise:** Full monitoring, unlimited agents, advanced features

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### TypeScript Compliance
- Branded types for agent IDs and modes
- Strict typing for all component props
- No `any` types used
- Proper error handling and state management

### Accessibility Features
- Keyboard navigation support
- Proper ARIA attributes
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management

### Performance Optimizations
- Real-time updates with configurable intervals
- Efficient state management with useCallback
- Component memoization where appropriate
- Background data fetching

### Testing Coverage
- Comprehensive unit tests for AgentModeSwitch
- Edge case handling (undefined agents, mixed statuses)
- Accessibility and interaction testing
- Status color and progress bar validation

## ðŸš€ Integration Points

### Existing Components
- **AutonomousDashboard**: Integrated for autonomous development features
- **EnhancedDashboard**: Integrated for analytics and insights
- **UI Components**: Uses shadcn/ui Button and utilities

### API Endpoints
